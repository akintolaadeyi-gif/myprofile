        <h1>Collins Akinola Adeyi</h1>
        <p>I'm Akinola Adeyi, my friends call me AK D Greatest. A fresh face in the world of software development! I've always been fascinated by how websites and applications come to life, and I'm incredibly excited to start building my own digital creations. Right now, I'm diving headfirst into the basics of HTML and CSS, eager to understand the structure and styling that make up the web. My journey is just beginning, but I'm determined to learn and grow with every line of code I write. I live in the vibrant city of Lumina, where the tech scene is buzzing with innovation, providing endless inspiration for my coding adventures..</p>

        <div class="card"><h1>My Progress</h1></div>
        <div class="card">My current focus is on mastering the fundamentals. I'm practicing creating simple web pages with different layouts, experimenting with colors, fonts, and spacing to understand how CSS affects the visual presentation. </div>
        <div class="card">I'm also exploring the use of divs and spans to structure content effectively. One of my recent projects involved building a personal portfolio page, where I showcased my (very) limited skills and projects. It was a challenging but rewarding experience that taught me a lot about the importance of clean, semantic code. I'm also learning about responsive design, ensuring that my web pages look great on any device, from desktops to smartphones.
<p>Outside of coding, I'm an avid reader and a passionate hiker. I believe that spending time in nature helps clear my mind and sparks creativity, which is essential for problem-solving in programming. I'm also a member of a local tech community where I connect with other developers, share ideas, and learn from their experiences. My goal is to become a proficient front-end developer, contributing to meaningful projects and making a positive impact through technology.
I'm open to any advice or suggestions as I continue on this exciting path!<P></div>
